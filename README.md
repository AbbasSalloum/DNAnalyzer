## Overview
This beta software uses a modified version of the Boyer-Moore algorithm to analyze genomic sequences for the genes of amino acids, start and stop codons, regions with high GC-content, transcription factors, and regulatory elements.

## Background
The human genome is comprised of over 3 billion base pairs, making manual analysis nearly impossible. Consequently, using powerful computational and statistical methods to decode the functional information hidden in DNA sequences are necessary. The genome is also extremely intricate and contains a plethora of structured data types, which need to be organized and structured appropriately.

## Features
* Start and stop codons
  * Indicate the start and stop of an amino acid. There are 20 different amino acids. A protein consists of one or more chains of amino acids (called polypeptides) whose sequence is encoded in a gene.
* High coverage regions (45-60% GC-content)
  * Regions of a DNA genome that code for a protein and have a relatively high proportion of cytosine and guanine nucleotides to the 4 nucleotide bases.
* Longest genes
  * Most susceptible to disease implications and are especially linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism)
* Transcription factors
  * Proteins that help turn specific genes "on" or "off" by binding to nearby DNA.
* Regulatory elements
  * Binding sites for transcription factors, which are involved in gene regulation.

## Impact
Researchers are working to extract valuable information from software such as this in order to better understand human health and disease.
