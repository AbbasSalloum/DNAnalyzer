# Algorithm for Analyzing Genes in DNA
This software analyzes genomic sequences.
## Background Information
The human genome is comprised of over 3 billion base pairs, making manual analysis nearly impossible. Finding information in the genome hence necessitates computer techniques. Furthermore, the genome is highly complicated and contains several types of data. 
## How Does it Work?
My software begins by examining the nucleotides for start and end codons, which indicate where proteins (usually amino acids) are located. In addition to genes, my software searches for regulatory elements and proteins known as transcription factors, which aid in the activation and deactivation of genes.
